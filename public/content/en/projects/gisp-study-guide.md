With the GISP exam coming up in a few months, I have been studying for it. There was a call for volunteers to help with a GISP study guide, and I started having fun with it and went full throttle. It's still and work in progress, it's a site to quickly and easily access the study guide resources as well as flash cards and a practice exam. **CHECK IT OUT** [HERE](https://altwitt.github.io/gisp/)
